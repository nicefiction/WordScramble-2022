/// Checking for misspelled words;
/// Checking a string for misspelled words takes four steps in total.
/// `STEP 1`
/// First, we create a word to check
/// and an instance of `UITextChecker` that we can use to check that string:

let wordToCheck: String = "hello"
let uiTextChecker = UITextChecker.init()

/// `STEP 2`
/// Second, we need to tell the checker how much of our string we want to check.

let nsRange = NSRange(location: 0, length: wordToCheck.utf16.count)

/// NOTE: We need to ask Swift to create an Objective-C string range
/// using the entire length of all our characters,.
/// The reason is because Objective C does not have a way to deal with special String characters like emojis.

/// `STEP 3`
/// Third, we can ask our text checker
/// to report where it found any misspellings in our word:

let rangeOfMispelledWords = uiTextChecker.rangeOfMisspelledWord(in: wordToCheck,
                                                                range: nsRange,

                                                                language: "en")
/// `STEP 4`
/// There is still one complexity here:
/// Objective-C didnâ€™t have any concept of optionals,
/// so instead relied on special values to represent missing data.
